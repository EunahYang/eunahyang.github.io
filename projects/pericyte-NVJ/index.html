Functional hyperemia, often treated as an outcome of neural activity, is in fact an essential component of sustaining that activity. During this project, I began to see NVC not as a simple signal–response mechanism, but as a dynamic system operating under the physical constraints of the vascular network itself.</p> <p>I was particularly intrigued by how <strong>systemic and vascular mechanical factors</strong> might set the boundary conditions for NVC. Physiological changes such as arterial stiffness, vascular calcification, and hemodynamic force imbalance alter the compliance of blood vessels and the distribution of shear stress along the vessel wall. These changes can bias the flow of red blood cells, disturb the uniformity of oxygen delivery, and accumulate mechanical stress within small vessels. Although such processes have been well-characterized in cardiovascular physiology, their consequences within the cerebral microcirculation remain less understood.</p> <p>At the microvascular scale, <strong>pericytes</strong> are thought to regulate capillary tone and mediate localized adjustments in blood flow. However, pericytes are structurally heterogeneous and sparse in the deeper capillary orders, where contractile regulation becomes limited. This raises a fundamental question: how does the brain maintain its remarkable spatial precision in blood flow control in regions that lack sufficient contractile support? Could passive mechanics and upstream vascular dynamics alone coordinate energy distribution, or is there an additional layer of flow organization we do not yet capture in current imaging?</p> <p>The project was designed to probe these questions conceptually. Using the framework of <strong>vascular stiffness and disturbed flow as mechanical perturbations</strong>, I aimed to understand how the coupling between neuronal activity, vascular resistance, and oxygen metabolism might reorganize under mechanical stress. I speculated that under increased stiffness, the temporal synchronization between neuronal activation and local perfusion — the very basis of the BOLD signal — could begin to decouple, revealing new physiological signatures of vascular fragility.</p> <p>Although this work remained in its early phase, it shaped how I now think about the brain as a <strong>mechanically constrained dynamical system</strong>. The experience reframed my interest from cellular-level physiology to system-level modeling: how physical properties of blood vessels influence dynamic energy distribution and stability in neural networks. This conceptual shift continues to inform my current research in <strong>computational modeling of brain networks and state transitions</strong>, where I explore how the brain sustains function under changing internal and external conditions.</p> <p>The brain is an energy-intensive organ, continuously consuming resources to sustain its electrical and metabolic activity. Yet, this demand is not uniform — it fluctuates across regions and moments, as local populations of neurons transiently require more oxygen and nutrients. The ability to regulate and match blood flow to these changing demands is known as <em>neurovascular coupling (NVC).</em> I came to view NVC not merely as a signaling sequence from neuron to vessel, but as a <strong>dynamic system operating under the physical constraints of vascular dynamics itself.</strong></p> <p>What intrigued me most was not how this system works under ideal conditions, but how it <strong>maintains precision under physical limitations.</strong> Deep within the capillary network, where contractile support is sparse and pericytes are morphologically heterogeneous, the brain still manages to fine-tune its blood flow with remarkable spatial and temporal accuracy. <em>How can such precision persist in regions that lack active contractility?</em> Could passive mechanics and upstream hemodynamics alone coordinate the redistribution of energy, or is there an additional layer of flow organization that our current imaging methods fail to capture?</p> <p>These questions led me to examine the <strong>mechanical side of neurovascular control</strong> — to think of vascular properties as boundary conditions that shape how neural activity is translated into blood flow. Physiological factors such as arterial stiffness, vascular calcification, or altered shear stress can change the compliance of vessels and distort local hemodynamic responses. These mechanical alterations may bias red blood cell flux, slow the evolution of cerebral blood volume, and ultimately disrupt the coupling between neural activity and cerebral blood flow. In this sense, vascular mechanics define not just how much blood reaches the brain, but how precisely and responsively it can do so.</p> <p>At a broader level, I began to see NVC as a system that operates near the edge of mechanical equilibrium. Small perturbations in vascular elasticity or flow resistance could propagate through the capillary network, producing spatially uneven oxygen delivery — a subtle but potentially critical constraint on brain metabolism. Understanding these boundary conditions, and how they shape the brain’s dynamic energy landscape, could provide a new perspective on how vascular and neural systems co-regulate stability and adaptability.</p> <p>Although this project remained in its conceptual phase, it marked a turning point in how I think about brain function. Moving from experimental physiology toward computational and systems-level modeling, I became increasingly interested in the <strong>brain as a mechanically constrained dynamical system</strong> — one that must continuously negotiate between neural demand, vascular supply, and the physical limits of its own infrastructure. This view continues to inform my current research on dynamic brain networks and energy distribution across cognitive states. neural activation에 따른 dynamic demand 조절에 어떤 deficit이 생기는지</p> <p>The brain is an energy-intensive organ, continuously consuming resources to sustain its electrical and metabolic activity.
