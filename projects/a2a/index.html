However, reliance on predefined parcellations limits interoperability, as structural or functional connectomes (FC) from different atlases cannot be directly compared due to variations in spatial distribution. Understanding and resolving these atlas-dependent differences is essential for improving reproducibility in connectome-based brain research.</p> <p>To address this interoperability challenge, we introduce a cross-atlas connectome transformation model by adapting the connectome transformation modeling framework (Yoo et al., 2022). This approach learns low-dimensional representations and mapping between source and target parcellations through PCAs and PLS regression, allowing reconstruction of target-atlas whole-brain connectomes solely from one source-atlas representation without requiring raw fMRI data.</p> <p>Overall, the connectome transformation modeling framework provides a flexible and generalizable approach for bridging atlas-specific functional connectomes. By enabling cross-atlas mapping without direct access to raw imaging data, this approach helps enhance the comparison and interpretation of large-scale connectome research.</p> <p>Presentations (upcoming):</p> <ul> <li>KHBM 2025 Fall Conference (Korean Society of Human Brain Mapping), Seoul, Korea (abstract accepted for poster presentation)</li> <li>SfN 2025 (Society for Neuroscience), San Diego, US (Abstract accepted; co-author and co-presenter)</li> </ul> </body></html>
