I majored in biology, studying traditional disciplines such as biochem, genetics, molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. My first exposure to neuroscience came during a short summer session at UC Berkeley, where I found how differently the brain could be studied compared to the biology I knew.  

Later, I had the opportunity to return to Berkeley through a fully funded exchange semester on 2020. Among all the courses I took, <i>Genetic Factors of Neuropsychology</i> changed how I thought about science. Until then, I had viewed “intervention” only through pharmacological intervention. But when the professor discussed the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 and how redefining autism as a spectrum could expand access to care and insurance coverage, it was such a eureka moment for me. I realized that research doesn’t need to end with a prescription to have an impact. (Yet, new drugs with efficacy is surely crucial) Sometimes, understanding a disorder more accurately, redefining its boundaries, and carefully measuring its risk factors could directly improve lives. That was the moment I began to see neuroscience not just as molecular mechanisms of the brain, but as a way to connect scientific understanding to real human outcomes.
