<h5 style="font-weight:700;">Second half of the master's program</h5>

Luckily, my master lab also did human brain MRI studies alongside with mouse experiments, and I decided to transit from the wet lab to the dry lab.

<h5 style="font-weight:700;">First half of the master's program</h5>

During the first half of my master’s program, I was interested in how the brain distributes energy and manages local blood flow. I was curious how this coupling is regulated: neuronal signaling operates on a millisecond timescale, whereas vessel dilation and contraction are much slower. How does the brain keep the timing in sync?

I also wondered about the global coordination of blood flow. The brain cannot drastically increase total blood volume every time activity rises; instead, it must redistribute limited resources across regions. How does it decide where to send blood moment by moment? While reading papers on cerebrovascular physiology, I found the hierarchical structure of the vasculature especially intriguing. Larger upstream vessels are surrounded by smooth muscle cells with active contractility, but as vessels branch deeper into the parenchyma, they are no longer wrapped by smooth muscle cells but by less contractile pericytes and even endothelial cells. This graudal loss of contractility makes deeper vessels respond more paassively. Then how does a neuronal response occurring deep in the tissue communicate upstream to secure the needed blood supply?

This led me to think about what happens when vessel health deteriorates. For example, calcification can stiffen arteries and impair their ability to buffer heart pulsations. Even when a abnormal physiological state doesn’t target the brain directly, could systemic cardiovascular conditions still influence the brain by altering energy distribution? These were the kinds of questions that drew me into studying the neurovascular coupling.

This is the sad part: I couldn't further develop or finish this project. My existing mouse allergy (I had managed with medication) became severely sansitized during this study, and I eventually experienced anaphylactic shocks that made it impossible to even breathe in the same room with mice. If you don't mind some early and unpolished ideas from that time, you can take a look [here.](https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/pericyte-NVJ/)


<h5 style="font-weight:700;">Undergraduate years</h5>

I majored biology, studying traditional disciplines such as biochem, genetics, molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. My first exposure to neuroscience came during a short summer session at UC Berkeley, where I found how differently the brain could be studied compared to the biology I have known.  

Later, I had the opportunity to return to Berkeley through a fully funded exchange semester in 2020. Among all the courses I took, <i>Genetic Factors of Neuropsychology</i> changed how I thought about science. Until then, I had viewed “intervention” only through pharmacological means. But when the professor explained the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 and how redefining autism as a spectrum could expand access to care and insurance coverage, it was such a <i>eureka</i> moment for me. I realized that research doesn’t need to end with a prescription to have an impact. (Yet, developing drugs with proven efficacy is surely crucial) Sometimes, understanding a disorder more accurately, redefining its boundaries, and carefully measuring its risk factors could directly improve lives. That was the moment I began to see neuroscience not just as molecular mechanisms of the brain, but as a way to connect scientific understanding to real human outcomes.

After returning to Korea, I began my first research internship. At that time, I was obsessed with the idea of what makes something truly <i>interventible</i>. I thought meaningful interventions should target modifiable factors, mostly external or physiological influences rather than fixed genetics. If such factors broadly affect people, modifying those chould have a wider impact.

Therefore, I focused on the <i>Blood</i> which circulates throughout the whole body, and immune system as an alternating factor that could make blood sticky and hypercoagulable(easy to form blood clots). Rather than the immune system's role in identifying enemies or cytotoxic cascades, I was more interested in the systemic and indirect effects that may influence the brain. The notion of the brain as an immune previleged organ felt incomplete, especially as COVID-19 revealed cognitive symptoms like brain fog. Through a small exploratory project using infected mice, I observed how immune activation might change the characteristic of the blood, and alter blood-brain-barrier integrity and vulnerable to hypoxic stress.

Through this project, I began to study brain vasculature and realized how dynamic it is. I learned that blood flow can contribute to the clearance system (such as glympathic pathway). And the blood flow are altered by neurovascular coupling and pathological proteins such as APP deteriorates the BBB and hamper the normal circulation. Growing interest in coordination between neural activity and local blood supply drove me to apply master program.
