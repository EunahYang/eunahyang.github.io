Research Question 2

Research Question 3




Someone once told me that no one is ever fully satisfied with their own research. There there are always shortcommings, remaining (and even emerging) questions, and things you wish you had done differently. I felt the same as I wrapped up my master's project. Series of new questions began to emerge. Below is a schema of my current questions.

During the PD research that I have done during my masters, that was a group-level comparison study. But I became aware of how much variability could be lost when collasping into diganostic categories. And by attending conferences, such themes like heterogeneity between individuals and individual prognosis prediction were intriguing. When we conduct a research in a individual level, masking effects during group analysis could be reduced.

<h5 style="font-weight:700;">Second half of the master's program</h5>

At this stage, my research began to take a new direction toward human neuroimaging and network-level approaches. This was possible since my master’s lab also conducted human brain MRI studies alongside the animal experiments, and I decided to make a transition from the wet lab to the dry lab. The first few months were honestly rough. I didn’t even know how to open a raw T1 file, and every term sounded like a foreign language. Neuroimaging preprocessing and analysis pipelines felt completely distant from familiar wet-lab world. I didn’t know what I don't know, and that uncertainty was overwhelming. With help from my labmates(extra thanks to my saviors), I began to weave things together. I still remember the thrill when I first opened a 3D MRI volume, and later when I ran my first voxel-based analysis demo with SPM and saw clusters appear on the screen <i>I actually did this!</i>

Moving into the dry lab also changed how I thought about the brain. In mouse studies, I was used to tracing relatively direct cause-and-effect relationships within defined circuits. But in human brain networks, I found myself looking at something closer to real life: multiple regions interacting, forming patterns that change together. That shift—from single circuits to distributed networks—was a turning point for me. It didn’t negate what I had learned before (the brain is both a collection of cells and a network); it simply added a new dimension. 

After gaining some confidence with neuroimaging analysis, I began a collaborative project with Severance Hospital that investigated Parkinson’s disease from a mixed-pathological perspective—emphasizing amyloid accumulation as a potential source of phenotypic heterogeneity beyond motor symptoms. The project deepened my technical skills in multimodal imaging analysis and reshaped how I think about disease mechanisms: less as isolated pathologies, and more as interacting network-level phenomena. 

I took that step out of necessity, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made. The experience taught me that even when the path feels uncertain, it’s possible to learn and rebuild from scratch. More importantly, it showed me that there isn’t just one right way to reach the questions I care about—and that mindset continues to shape how I approach research today.

This project is now in its final stage, almost ready for submission. I hope to share my first publication soon. You can find a [brief overview of this project and my posters here.](https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/pd-amyloid/)

<h4 style="font-weight:700;">First half of the master's program</h4>

During the first half of my master’s program, I was interested in how the brain distributes energy and manages local blood flow. I was curious how this coupling is regulated: neuronal signaling operates on a millisecond timescale, whereas vessel dilation and contraction are much slower. How does the brain keep the timing in sync?

I also wondered about the global coordination of blood flow. The brain cannot drastically increase total blood volume every time activity rises; instead, it must redistribute limited resources across regions. How does it decide where to send blood moment by moment? While reading papers on cerebrovascular physiology, I found the hierarchical organization of the brain vessel especially interesting. Vessels close to proximal branches (or small-order branches) are surrounded by smooth muscle cells with active contractility, but as vessels bifurcate into smaller perforating branches that penetrate deeper into the parenchyma, they are no longer wrapped by smooth muscle cells but by less contractile pericytes and even endothelial cells. This graudal loss of contractility makes deeper vessels respond more paassively. Then how does a neuronal response occurring deep in the tissue communicate upstream to secure the needed blood supply?

This led me to think about what happens when vessel health deteriorates. For example, calcification can stiffen arteries and impair their ability to buffer heart pulsations. Even when a abnormal physiological state doesn’t target the brain directly, could systemic cardiovascular conditions still influence the brain by altering energy distribution? These were the kinds of questions that drew me into studying the neurovascular coupling.

This is the sad part: I couldn't further develop or finish this project. My existing mouse allergy (I had managed with medication) became severely sansitized during this study, and I eventually experienced anaphylactic shocks that made it impossible to even breathe in the same room with mice. If you don't mind some early and unpolished ideas from that time, [you can take a look here.](https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/pericyte-NVJ/)

<h4 style="font-weight:700;">Undergraduate years</h4>

I majored biology, studying fundamental disciplines such as biochem, genetics, molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. My first exposure to neuroscience came during a short summer session at UC Berkeley, where I found how differently the brain could be studied compared to the biology I have known.  

Later, during a fully funded exchange semester, returning at Berkeley, I took <i>Genetic Factors of Neuropsychology</i>, and this course changed how I thought about science. Until then, I had viewed “intervention” only through pharmacological means. But learning about the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 and how redefining autism as a spectrum could expand access to care and insurance coverage, was a <i>eureka</i> moment. I realized that research doesn’t need to end with a prescription to have an impact. 
Sometimes, understanding a disorder more accurately and carefully measuring its risk factors could directly improve quality of lives. That was the moment I began to see neuroscience not just as molecular mechanisms of the brain, but as a way to connect scientific understanding to real human outcomes.

At that time, I was obsessed with the idea:
> What makes something truly interventible? Are there modifiable and systmic factors that can indirectly shape brain health in broad populations?

Returning to Korea, I began my first research internship with this question in mind. I focused on how peripheral physiology could influence the brain, particulary through the circulating system.

Through this project, I began to study brain vasculature and realized how dynamic it is. I learned that blood flow can contribute to the clearance system (such as glympathic pathway). And the blood flow are altered by neurovascular coupling and pathological proteins. Growing interest in coordination between neural activity and local blood supply drove me to apply master program.
