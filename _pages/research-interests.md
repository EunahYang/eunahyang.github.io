<h4 style="font-weight:700;">Current</h4>

Life experiences are transient, yet they often leave lasting footprints on the mind and brain. The brain recognizes, perceives, and translates the experiences, but is also shaped by them, and these processes are unique to every individual. These fingerprint-like cognitive dynamics, and how this variability emerges from brain network dynamics, are my biggest questions.

My interest in individual differences in cognition and behavior stemmed from conducting my master’s thesis project at KAIST. I realized how challenging it was to envision a subject showing abnormal phenotypes based on limited symptom severity scores in the demographics Excel sheets labeled ‘memory,’ ‘apathy,’ and ‘motivation.’ Such scores are insufficient to represent an individual's cognitive and mental state. 



<!--
During the latter part of my master’s project, I began to question how individuals behave, think, and feel, and what it truly means to live with reduced motivation or emotional flatness. As I worked with clinical data, I realized that much of the individuality behind these experiences was lost when transformed into numerical scalars or group-level averages. Those numbers, labeled as “apathy” or “motivation,” often felt disconnected from the 4D human (lived realities) they were meant to represent. This realization led me to think about how we might better capture cognitive and behavioral phenotype that differ across individuals. Through prediction modeling, I came to see that identifying meaningful features that explain variance in outcomes offers a more individualized view of brain–behavior relationships. Yet studies of higher-order cognition and neuropsychiatric phenotypes frequently implicate overlapping regions, raising questions about how to represent the brain in a way that reflects its functional diversity. These experiences shaped my current focus on biologically grounded, multivariate representations of cognition that link brain network organization with individual differences in mental processes and behavior.

In the latter phase of my master’s work, I realized that group-level labels and numerical scores often obscured what mattered most: the lived, heterogeneous experiences of individuals. Voxel-level associations frequently overlapped across regions, reinforcing that our conclusions hinge on how we represent the brain—through atlases, eigenmodes, or connectivity. This led me to move beyond categorical comparisons toward biologically grounded, multivariate representations at the network level. That shift now motivates my central questions: (a) individual differences in cognitive state transitions, (b) predictive, biologically anchored representations of cognition, and (c) interpretable links between latent cognitive dimensions and network dynamics for personalized interventions.

What defines individuals cognitive process and how can we quantify those in
During the PD research that I have done during my masters, that was a group-level comparison study. But I became aware of how much variability could be lost when collasping into diganostic categories. And by attending conferences, such themes like heterogeneity between individuals and individual prognosis prediction were intriguing. When we conduct a research in a individual level, masking effects during group analysis could be reduced.

> <p style="font-weight:700;">a. How do individual differences in cognitive state transitions shape how people interpret and adapt to internal and external experiences?</p>

Even when facing identical environments, people perceive, evaluate, and internalize experiences differently. These variations likely arise from distinct configurations and dynamics of cognitive processes—such as attention allocation, internal mentation, and evaluative control—that interact bidirectionally with external inputs. Over time, these processes accumulate as personalized interpretive “biases” or priors within each individual’s brain network. I aim to understand how such cognitive state transitions—particularly those governing internally oriented attention—differ across individuals and give rise to distinct behavioral and emotional patterns.
> <p style="font-weight:700;">b. How can biologically grounded, multivariate representations of cognition improve the prediction of individual behavioral and mental states?</p>

Moving beyond categorical descriptions, I seek to represent individuals along latent cognitive dimensions derived from multivariate modeling of brain–behavior data. Such representations can reveal the neural mechanisms underlying latent variables identified in question a, capturing continuous axes of phenotypic variability rather than discrete groupings. By anchoring these representations in biological substrates, I hope to establish a predictive framework that links individual brain network configurations with moment-to-moment cognitive dynamics.
> <p style="font-weight:700;">c. How can mapping latent cognitive dimensions onto brain network dynamics advance interpretable and personalized interventions?</p>

By embedding latent cognitive factors within the dynamic architecture of brain networks, we may obtain more interpretable and biologically grounded markers of mental function. Such an approach could inform when, where, and for whom an intervention is most effective—bridging mechanistic understanding with clinical applicability. Ultimately, this framework aims to refine both theoretical models of cognition and practical strategies for individualized mental-health care.

Someone once told me that no one is ever fully satisfied with their own research. There there are always shortcommings, remaining (and even emerging) questions, and things you wish you had done differently. I felt the same as I wrapped up my master's project. Series of new questions began to emerge. Below is a schema of my current questions.

<h4 style="font-weight:700;">Second half of the master's program</h4>

My research began to take a new direction toward human neuroimaging and network-level approaches. It felt like entering an entirely new world. I didn't even know how to open a raw T1 file at first. Everything felt foreign and overly abstract. But as I learned and practiced, I realized that what initially felt abstract was simply a different way to describe the same brain from a network/system level. It was interesting to see how distal brain regions synchronize and collectively generate human behavior as an output. Working with human MRI felt closer to real life. Instaed of focusing on a single circuit, I learned to analyze structural networks and closely followed functional analyses from non-invasive human MRI data.

> How would the individuals behave, think or feel? What would it mean to live with reduced drive or emotional flatness?<br>And how could those phenotype originate from the brain's architecture?

While working on this project, I began to think deeply about disease complexity and individual heterogeneity. Patient with the same diagnosis could differ significantly in their symptoms and experiences. When I saw columns labeled 'apathy' or 'motivation' in the dataset (represented as numerical scores), I found it difficult to envision what those numbers actulally represented in an actual human being. Even after reading the questionnaires that was used to derive those scores, I kept wondering what these humans with that score/lables felt like from the inside. That gap between quantified measures and realities became one of the most interesting and unresolved questions for me.

<h4 style="font-weight:700;">First half of the master's program</h4>

In the early part of my master’s program, I was interested in how how the brain distributes energy with precise spatiotemporal coordination. Neurons fire within milliseconds, while vessels adjust over seconds, yet the resulting hemodynamic signal remains coherent across space and time.

> How is such temporal precision and region specific coordination maintained in the neurovascular system?<br>What happens when the mechanical condition of this system begin to fail?

These questions led me to view neurovascular coupling as a dynamic control problem embedded in a hierarchical vascular network. I learned that the hierarchical organization of the brain vessel especially interesting. Vessels close to proximal branches (or small-order branches) are surrounded by smooth muscle cells with active contractility, but as vessels bifurcate into smaller perforating branches that penetrate deeper into the parenchyma, they are no longer wrapped by smooth muscle cells but by less contractile pericytes and even endothelial cells. This graudal loss of contractility makes deeper vessels respond more paassively. Then how does a neuronal response occurring deep in the tissue communicate upstream to secure the needed blood supply?

Before tackling these big questions, I wanted to start by examining one aspect of the system that mechanical properties of vessels being the boundary conditions for neurovascular coupling. I focused on how mechanical stress (originating from arterial stiffness) could distort the fine balance between neuronal demand and vascular response, even when pathology didn't originate in the brain. Although I had to discontinue this work after developing severe mouse allergies, this experience was a turning point for me to shift toward network neuroscience.

<h4 style="font-weight:700;">Undergraduate years</h4>

I majored biology, studying fundamental disciplines such as biochem, genetics, molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. My first exposure to neuroscience came during a short summer session at UC Berkeley, where I found how differently the brain could be studied compared to the biology I have known.  

Later, during a fully funded exchange semester, returning at Berkeley, I took <i>Genetic Factors of Neuropsychology</i>, and this course changed how I thought about science. Until then, I had viewed “intervention” only through pharmacological means. But learning about the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 and how redefining autism as a spectrum could expand access to care and insurance coverage, was a <i>eureka</i> moment. I realized that research doesn’t need to end with a prescription to have an impact. 
Sometimes, understanding a disorder more accurately and carefully measuring its risk factors could directly improve quality of lives. That was the moment I began to see neuroscience not just as molecular mechanisms of the brain, but as a way to connect scientific understanding to real human outcomes.

At that time, I was obsessed with the idea:
> What makes something truly interventible? Are there modifiable and systmic factors that can indirectly have an impact on brain health in broad populations?

Returning to Korea, I began my first full-time internship with this question in mind. For detailed project description: [click here](https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/eosinophil-bbb/)

Through this project, I began to study brain vasculature and realized how dynamic it is. I learned that blood flow can contribute to the clearance system (such as glympathic pathway). And the blood flow are altered by neurovascular coupling and pathological proteins. Growing interest in coordination between neural activity and local blood supply drove me to apply master program.
