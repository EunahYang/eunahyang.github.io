Hi, I am Eunah(pronounce: ɯna) and I study network neuroscience.

I’m interested in understanding how individual differences in cognitive dynamics emerge from adaptive brain network processes and how such representations can improve our ability to describe and predict human behavior. Individuals show distinct patterns of perception, attention, cognitive processes, and adaptability to external stimuli and demands. I want to focus on heterogeneity not as noise but as meaningful variability that is commonly trimmed and flattened.

Currently, I'm a research assistant at Samsung Medical Center (SMC), working with [Prof. Kwangsun Ray Yoo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6ogPgMAAAAJ&hl=ko). [My current works](https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/#Current) focus on bridging computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience with brain networks. Mostly, I use brain fMRI data to build connectome-based predictive models and explore how brain network inform individualized cognition and phenotypical differences.

Before this, I received my M.S. in the Dept. of Bio and Brain Engineering at KAIST, under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Jeong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zsVfg6sAAAAJ&hl=ko). [My project](https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/pd-amyloid/) explored Parkinson's disease heterogeneity from a mixed-pathological perspective, focusing on the cognitive and neuropsychiatric burdens beyond motor deficits. 

Earlier, I earned my B.S. in Life Sceince at GIST, where I did my [very first individual project](https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/eosinophil-bbb/) in [Prof. Tae Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A_diSGUAAAAJ&hl=en)'s lab. I explored how eosinophilia-induced hypoxia affects brain vasculature integrity in mice.
