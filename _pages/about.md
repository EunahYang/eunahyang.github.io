Hi, I am Eunah(pronounce: É¯na) and I study network neuroscience. I'm interested on how all of us are different and feels similar at the same time.

Currently, I'm a research assistance at Samsung Medical Center (SMC), working with [Prof. Kwangsun Ray Yoo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6ogPgMAAAAJ&hl=ko). I use brain MRIs to quantify? brain networks and .

Before this, I received my M.S. in Dept. of Bio and Brain Engineering at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Jeong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zsVfg6sAAAAJ&hl=ko). My dissertation focused on a mixed-pathological approach to Parkinson's disease heterogeneity. Using DTI and amyloid PET, I investigated cognitive and neuropsychiatric burdens that affect patients beyond motor deficits. Check out the 'Research/' section.
