My existing mouse allergy (I had managed with medication) became severely sansitized during this study, and I eventually experienced anaphylactic shocks that made it impossible to even breathe in the same room with mice. If you don’t mind some early and unpolished ideas from that time, you can take a look <a href="https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/pericyte_NVJ/">here.</a></p> <h5 style="font-weight:700;">Undergraduate years</h5> <p>I majored biology, studying traditional disciplines such as biochem, genetics, molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. My first exposure to neuroscience came during a short summer session at UC Berkeley, where I found how differently the brain could be studied compared to the biology I have known.</p> <p>Later, I had the opportunity to return to Berkeley through a fully funded exchange semester in 2020. Among all the courses I took, <i>Genetic Factors of Neuropsychology</i> changed how I thought about science. Until then, I had viewed “intervention” only through pharmacological means. But when the professor explained the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 and how redefining autism as a spectrum could expand access to care and insurance coverage, it was such a <i>eureka</i> moment for me. I realized that research doesn’t need to end with a prescription to have an impact. (Yet, developing drugs with proven efficacy is surely crucial) Sometimes, understanding a disorder more accurately, redefining its boundaries, and carefully measuring its risk factors could directly improve lives. That was the moment I began to see neuroscience not just as molecular mechanisms of the brain, but as a way to connect scientific understanding to real human outcomes.</p> <p>After returning to Korea, I began my first research internship. At that time, I was obsessed with the idea of what makes something truly <i>interventible</i>. I thought meaningful interventions should target modifiable factors, mostly external or physiological influences rather than fixed genetics. If such factors broadly affect people, modifying those chould have a wider impact.</p> <p>Therefore, I focused on the <i>Blood</i> which circulates throughout the whole body, and immune system as an alternating factor that could make blood sticky and hypercoagulable(easy to form blood clots). Rather than the immune system’s role in identifying enemies or cytotoxic cascades, I was more interested in the systemic and indirect effects that may influence the brain. The notion of the brain as an immune previleged organ felt incomplete, especially as COVID-19 revealed cognitive symptoms like brain fog. Through a small exploratory project using infected mice, I observed how immune activation might change the characteristic of the blood, and alter blood-brain-barrier integrity and vulnerable to hypoxic stress. For detailed information of this project, <a href="https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/eosinophil_bbb/">click here</a></p> <p>Through this project, I began to study brain vasculature and realized how dynamic it is. I learned that blood flow can contribute to the clearance system (such as glympathic pathway). And the blood flow are altered by neurovascular coupling and pathological proteins such as APP deteriorates the BBB and hamper the normal circulation. Growing interest in coordination between neural activity and local blood supply drove me to apply master program.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Eunah Yang.
