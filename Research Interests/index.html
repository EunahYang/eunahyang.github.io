There there are always shortcommings, remaining (and even emerging) questions, and things you wish you had done differently. I felt the same as I wrapped up my master’s project. Series of new questions began to emerge. Below is a schema of my current questions.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/5-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/5-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Current Questions" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Caption here.</p> <p>Descriptions here</p> <p>Brief descriptions of my current projects can be found in the <a href="https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/">‘Current’ section of the Project menu.</a></p> <h5 style="font-weight:700;">Second half of the master's program</h5> <p>At this stage, my research began to take a new direction—toward human neuroimaging and network-level approaches to understanding disease mechanisms. Luckily, my master’s lab also conducted human brain MRI studies alongside the animal experiments, and I decided to make a bold transition from the wet lab to the dry lab. The first few months were honestly rough—I didn’t even know how to open a file without double-clicking it, and every term sounded like a foreign language. Neuroimaging preprocessing and analysis pipelines felt completely disconnected from the wet-lab “protocol” world I was used to. I didn’t know what I didn’t know, and that uncertainty was overwhelming.</p> <p>Luckily, my master’s lab also conducted human brain MRI studies alongside the animal experiments, and I decided to make a bold transition from the wet lab to the dry lab.

Neuroimaging preprocessing and analysis pipelines felt completely disconnected from the wet-lab “protocol” world I was used to. I didn’t know what I didn’t know, and that uncertainty was overwhelming.</p> <p>With patient guidance from my labmates, I slowly began to piece things together. They showed me how to run PET analyses step by step, and I wrote everything down, repeating the process until it started to make sense. I still remember the thrill when I first opened a 3D MRI volume, and later when I ran my first voxel-based analysis and saw clusters appear on the screen—<em>I actually did this</em>.</p> <p>Moving into the dry lab also changed how I thought about the brain. In mouse studies, I was used to tracing relatively direct cause-and-effect relationships within defined circuits. But in human brain networks, I found myself looking at something closer to real life: multiple regions interacting, forming patterns that change together. That shift—from single circuits to distributed networks—was a turning point for me. It didn’t negate what I had learned before (the brain is both a collection of cells and a network); it simply added a new dimension.</p> <p>Moving into the dry lab also changed how I thought about the brain.

It didn’t negate what I had learned before (the brain is both a collection of cells and a network); it simply added a new dimension.</p> <p>After gaining some confidence with neuroimaging analysis, I began a collaborative project with Severance Hospital that investigated Parkinson’s disease from a mixed-pathological perspective—emphasizing amyloid accumulation as a potential source of phenotypic heterogeneity beyond motor symptoms. The project deepened my technical skills in multimodal imaging analysis and reshaped how I think about disease mechanisms: less as isolated pathologies, and more as interacting network-level phenomena.</p> <p>I took that step out of necessity, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made. The experience taught me that even when the path feels uncertain, it’s possible to learn and rebuild from scratch. More importantly, it showed me that there isn’t just one right way to reach the questions I care about—and that mindset continues to shape how I approach research today.</p> <p>I took that step out of necessity, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made.

I hope to share my first publication soon.

I was curious how this coupling is regulated: neuronal signaling operates on a millisecond timescale, whereas vessel dilation and contraction are much slower. How does the brain keep the timing in sync?</p> <p>I also wondered about the global coordination of blood flow. The brain cannot drastically increase total blood volume every time activity rises; instead, it must redistribute limited resources across regions. How does it decide where to send blood moment by moment? While reading papers on cerebrovascular physiology, I found the hierarchical organization of the brain vessel especially interesting. Vessels close to proximal branches (or small-order branches) are surrounded by smooth muscle cells with active contractility, but as vessels bifurcate into smaller perforating branches that penetrate deeper into the parenchyma, they are no longer wrapped by smooth muscle cells but by less contractile pericytes and even endothelial cells. This graudal loss of contractility makes deeper vessels respond more paassively. Then how does a neuronal response occurring deep in the tissue communicate upstream to secure the needed blood supply?</p> <p>This led me to think about what happens when vessel health deteriorates. For example, calcification can stiffen arteries and impair their ability to buffer heart pulsations. Even when a abnormal physiological state doesn’t target the brain directly, could systemic cardiovascular conditions still influence the brain by altering energy distribution? These were the kinds of questions that drew me into studying the neurovascular coupling.</p> <p>This is the sad part: I couldn’t further develop or finish this project. My existing mouse allergy (I had managed with medication) became severely sansitized during this study, and I eventually experienced anaphylactic shocks that made it impossible to even breathe in the same room with mice. If you don’t mind some early and unpolished ideas from that time, <a href="https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/pericyte-NVJ/">you can take a look here.</a></p> <h5 style="font-weight:700;">Undergraduate years</h5> <p>I majored biology, studying traditional disciplines such as biochem, genetics, molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. My first exposure to neuroscience came during a short summer session at UC Berkeley, where I found how differently the brain could be studied compared to the biology I have known.</p> <p>Later, I had the opportunity to return to Berkeley through a fully funded exchange semester in 2020. Among all the courses I took, <i>Genetic Factors of Neuropsychology</i> changed how I thought about science. Until then, I had viewed “intervention” only through pharmacological means. But when the professor explained the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 and how redefining autism as a spectrum could expand access to care and insurance coverage, it was such a <i>eureka</i> moment for me. I realized that research doesn’t need to end with a prescription to have an impact. (Yet, developing drugs with proven efficacy is surely crucial) Sometimes, understanding a disorder more accurately, redefining its boundaries, and carefully measuring its risk factors could directly improve lives. That was the moment I began to see neuroscience not just as molecular mechanisms of the brain, but as a way to connect scientific understanding to real human outcomes.</p> <p>After returning to Korea, I began my first research internship. At that time, I was obsessed with the idea of what makes something truly <i>interventible</i>. I thought meaningful interventions should target modifiable factors, mostly external or physiological influences rather than fixed genetics. If such factors broadly affect people, modifying those chould have a wider impact.</p> <p>Therefore, I focused on the <i>Blood</i> which circulates throughout the whole body, and immune system as an alternating factor that could make blood sticky and hypercoagulable(easy to form blood clots). Rather than the immune system’s role in identifying enemies or cytotoxic cascades, I was more interested in the systemic and indirect effects that may influence the brain. The notion of the brain as an immune previleged organ felt incomplete, especially as COVID-19 revealed cognitive symptoms like brain fog. Through a small exploratory project using infected mice, I observed how immune activation might change the characteristic of the blood, and alter blood-brain-barrier integrity and vulnerable to hypoxic stress. <a href="https://eunahyang.github.io/projects/eosinophil-bbb/">For detailed information of this project, click here</a></p> <p>Through this project, I began to study brain vasculature and realized how dynamic it is. I learned that blood flow can contribute to the clearance system (such as glympathic pathway). And the blood flow are altered by neurovascular coupling and pathological proteins such as APP deteriorates the BBB and hamper the normal circulation. Growing interest in coordination between neural activity and local blood supply drove me to apply master program.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Eunah Yang.
