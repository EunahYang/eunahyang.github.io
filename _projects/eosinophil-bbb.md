This was my first full-time, on-site research experience at a time when the world was cautiously reopening after waves of COVID-19 lockdowns. The pandemic had shown how a viral infection could leave lasting effects beyond recovery. Survivors frequently reported what came to be known as 'brain fog'. Amid that uncertainty, I became curious about how systemic physiological changes originating outside the brain might quietly affect the brain's function and health.

Blood circulates throughout the body, delivering not only oxygen and nutrients but also molecular signals from immune activity. While the brain is often described as 'immune-privileged', I wondered: <i>could alterations in blood composition itself impose stress on the cerebrovascular system?</i>

I focused on parasite-induced immune activation as an example. Parasitic infections elevate eosinophil levels, and in turn, eosinophil secreted proteins can make the blood hypercoagulable(prone to clotting). Using mouse models, I visualized cerebral vasculature and identified distal vascular regions—areas most susceptible to reduced flow. In these regions, hypoxia-related factors were elevated, suggesting subtle but real cerebrovascular stress.

This project shaped my early interest in the relationship between brain and cerebrovasculature, where systemic conditions can influence the brain indirectly. It also led me toward later questions about neurovascular coupling and the glymphatic system, deepening my fascination with the brain circulation and its function.

Heightened parasitic stress는 fatal하지는 않지만 신체에 전반적인 inflammatoion을 야기하고, 이에 대응하는 eosinophil의 increase가 일반적. 그런데 eosinophil은 (원래 자기의 목적인) parasitic immune response를 진행하는 과정에서 분비되는 protein, ENT?(무슨 net...)등이 blood coagulation prone한 상태를 만들게 된다. 이러한 systemic risk가 뇌에 전달된다고 할 때, I hypothesized 가장 vulnerable한 region was watershed area. This is the area distal from major arteries of the brain, and mostly fed with 모세혈관. Human studies에서 보더라도 ischemia (그.. 무슨 이스케미아라고 하더라? 작은 혈관들 막히는...... 산발적인..... 그런거) was prevalant on those regions. However, mouse에서는 watershed area가 atlas-defined 된게 아니라서, vasculature를 염색, 현미경으로 찍고 coordinate 잡아서 추세선 그리고, major arteries에서 distal 한 region을 설정했다. 그 곳에서 biopsy를 해봤더니 hypoxia related factor가 qRT-PCR를 통해 상승한걸 볼 수 있었다.
