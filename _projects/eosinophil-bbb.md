Consider......
I focused on the Blood which circulates throughout the whole body, and immune system as an alternating factor that could make blood sticky and hypercoagulable(easy to form blood clots). Rather than the immune systemâ€™s role in identifying enemies or cytotoxic cascades, I was more interested in the systemic and indirect effects that may influence the brain. The notion of the brain as an immune previleged organ felt incomplete, especially as COVID-19 revealed cognitive symptoms like brain fog. Through a small exploratory project using infected mice, I observed how immune activation might change the characteristic of the blood, and alter blood-brain-barrier integrity and vulnerable to hypoxic stress.

** This project was presented as a department-wide undergraduate thesis seminar talk in the GIST School of Life Sciences, open to professors and students across the department.
