Traditional psychiatric research has largely relied on case–control comparisons, assuming that diagnostic categories can accurately capture differences in brain function. However, individuals within the same diagnosis often show striking variability in both symptoms and neural patterns, while those across different diagnoses may exhibit substantial overlap. This categorical framework—though clinically practical—oversimplifies the complex and continuous nature of mental health, limiting our ability to understand individual variation.

To address this, I adopt a transdiagnostic and dimensional approach that replaces binary diagnostic labels with multi-dimensional phenotypic profiles. These profiles are constructed from behavioral assessments such as CBCL and KSADS, representing each individual as a vector in a continuous behavioral space encompassing domains like emotion regulation, impulsivity, and cognitive control. Using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), I test whether patterns of functional connectivity can predict these behavioral vectors, thereby modeling psychiatric features as gradients rather than discrete categories.

Through this framework, I aim to uncover shared neural dimensions that transcend traditional diagnostic boundaries and explain the diverse ways symptoms manifest across individuals. Ultimately, this project seeks to bridge the gap between brain network dynamics and complex behavioral phenotypes, providing a quantitative, individualized, and biologically grounded view of mental health. By doing so, it contributes to a more flexible and integrative understanding of psychopathology—one that recognizes both common mechanisms and unique individual trajectories.
