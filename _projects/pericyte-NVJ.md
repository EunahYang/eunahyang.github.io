The brain dynamically redistributes blood flow to meet local energy demands — a process known as *neurovascular coupling (NVC)*.  
But this coupling depends not only on neural or metabolic signaling, but also on the **mechanical properties of the vascular network** itself.

This project began with a simple curiosity: if vascular calcification or stiffness alters the hemodynamic environment, how does that affect the brain’s ability to fine-tune blood supply?  
Changes in vessel compliance can distort shear stress, bias red blood cell flux, and disrupt the coordination of flow across microvascular networks.  
Such effects may be particularly critical in **deep capillary regions** where contractile pericytes are sparse, yet localized and temporally precise NVC still occurs.

I explored the idea that **vascular mechanics serve as a boundary condition for NVC**, shaping when and how neural activity is translated into blood flow.  
Although the work remained conceptual and preliminary, it became a foundation for my current interest in **computational modeling of energy distribution and dynamic state transitions in the brain**.



The brain constantly regulates its blood flow to match local activity — a phenomenon known as *neurovascular coupling (NVC)*. Functional hyperemia, often treated as an outcome of neural activity, is in fact an essential component of sustaining that activity. During this project, I began to see NVC not as a simple signal–response mechanism, but as a dynamic system operating under the physical constraints of the vascular network itself.

I was particularly intrigued by how **systemic and vascular mechanical factors** might set the boundary conditions for NVC. Physiological changes such as arterial stiffness, vascular calcification, and hemodynamic force imbalance alter the compliance of blood vessels and the distribution of shear stress along the vessel wall. These changes can bias the flow of red blood cells, disturb the uniformity of oxygen delivery, and accumulate mechanical stress within small vessels. Although such processes have been well-characterized in cardiovascular physiology, their consequences within the cerebral microcirculation remain less understood.

At the microvascular scale, **pericytes** are thought to regulate capillary tone and mediate localized adjustments in blood flow. However, pericytes are structurally heterogeneous and sparse in the deeper capillary orders, where contractile regulation becomes limited. This raises a fundamental question: how does the brain maintain its remarkable spatial precision in blood flow control in regions that lack sufficient contractile support? Could passive mechanics and upstream vascular dynamics alone coordinate energy distribution, or is there an additional layer of flow organization we do not yet capture in current imaging?

The project was designed to probe these questions conceptually. Using the framework of **vascular stiffness and disturbed flow as mechanical perturbations**, I aimed to understand how the coupling between neuronal activity, vascular resistance, and oxygen metabolism might reorganize under mechanical stress. I speculated that under increased stiffness, the temporal synchronization between neuronal activation and local perfusion — the very basis of the BOLD signal — could begin to decouple, revealing new physiological signatures of vascular fragility.

Although this work remained in its early phase, it shaped how I now think about the brain as a **mechanically constrained dynamical system**. The experience reframed my interest from cellular-level physiology to system-level modeling: how physical properties of blood vessels influence dynamic energy distribution and stability in neural networks. This conceptual shift continues to inform my current research in **computational modeling of brain networks and state transitions**, where I explore how the brain sustains function under changing internal and external conditions.
