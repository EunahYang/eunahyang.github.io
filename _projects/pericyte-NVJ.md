The brain dynamically redistributes blood flow to meet local energy demands — a process known as *neurovascular coupling (NVC)*.  
But this coupling depends not only on neural or metabolic signaling, but also on the **mechanical properties of the vascular network** itself.

This project began with a simple curiosity: if vascular calcification or stiffness alters the hemodynamic environment, how does that affect the brain’s ability to fine-tune blood supply?  
Changes in vessel compliance can distort shear stress, bias red blood cell flux, and disrupt the coordination of flow across microvascular networks.  
Such effects may be particularly critical in **deep capillary regions** where contractile pericytes are sparse, yet localized and temporally precise NVC still occurs.

I explored the idea that **vascular mechanics serve as a boundary condition for NVC**, shaping when and how neural activity is translated into blood flow.  
Although the work remained conceptual and preliminary, it became a foundation for my current interest in **computational modeling of energy distribution and dynamic state transitions in the brain**.
