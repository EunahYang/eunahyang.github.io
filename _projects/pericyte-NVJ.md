The brain is an energy-starved organ that continuously draws resources from the blood to sustain neuronal activity. This demand varies across regions and changes dynamically as local neural populations require more metabolic support as they fire. The process that regulates blood supply to these shifting energy demands is known as neurovascular coupling (NVC). This coupling is made possible by contractile cells that wrap around blood vessels, finely controlling vascular tone and perfusion. However, both the vessels and the cells that ensheath them are heterogeneously zonated. As vessels branch into smaller diameters, the contractility of mural cells diminishes and their coverage becomes sparser. At the capillary scale, pericytes are thought to regulate local tone and mediate fine-grained adjustments in flow, but their distribution and contractile capacity vary considerably.

Because blood flow is the means by which metabolic energy is delivered, I view NVC as a form of energy distribution across the brain. This led me to two main questions:
> (a) How does the mechanical stress to the vasculature set the boundary conditions for neurovascular coupling? <br> (b) How does the brain preserve NVC with spatial precision in regions that lack sufficient contractile support? Could passive hemodynamics from upstream vessels alone coordinate the redistribution of blood? If so, how do these regions signal their demand to higher-order vessels to dilate and increase cerebral blood flow/volume without excessive delay in the hemodynamic response?

These questions led me to examine the mechanical side of neurovascular control â€” to think of vascular properties as boundary conditions that shape how neural activity is translated into blood flow. Physiological factors such as arterial stiffness, vascular calcification, or altered shear stress can change the compliance of vessels and distort local hemodynamic responses. In particular, I was interested in how vascular calcification contributes to arterial stiffening and disrupts the normal buffering of pulsatile pressure. When the vessel wall loses its elasticity, the balance of hemodynamic forces becomes dysregulated. Over time, this imbalance further damages the endothelium, accelerates mechanical fatigue, and amplifies calcification, forming a vicious cycle of stiffness and stress.
