Electronic medical records (EMR) often contain hidden risks of data corruption due to human error—such as mislabeled samples or mistakes during the digitization of handwritten documents. Even if such cases are rare, they can have a critical impact on accurately tracking a patient’s clinical trajectory and prognosis.

In hospital settings, a delta-check is commonly used to identify suspicious records by flagging unusually large changes in specific measurements compared to previous values. When flagged, clinicians manually review nearby records to verify and annotate possible errors. However, this process cannot fully distinguish between genuine physiological changes and data contamination from another patient with a similar status, leaving many cases in a diagnostic gray zone.
