Despite the growing recognition of concurrent Alzheimer pathology as one of the major factors that aggravates cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in
Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanistic link between these symptoms and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated whether Aβ elicit white matter (WM) network disruption and further explored the potential clinical consequences.

This retrospective study included patients with PD who underwent 18 F-florbetaben positron emission tomography, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), and neuropsychological
assessments. After extracting Aβ-susceptible structural WM networks by comparing DTI-metrics (Fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) according to Aβ status, multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to explore the potential associations between Aβ burden, integrity of identified WM networks, and clinical measures (cognitive performance and NPS). We then performed mediation analyses to determine whether the network integrity mediated the effect of Aβ on clinical measures.

Among 165 patients enrolled, 48 showed amyloid-positive (Aβ+) scan (29.1%). Based on FA-weighted (FA-WMN) and MD-weighted WM networks (MD-WMN) derived from the difference in regional Aβ burden, Aβ+PD patients revealed more severe and widespread WM microstructural alterations particularly involving cortico-cortical and
cortico-striatal-limbic WM networks. Global Aβ burden was associated with cognitive dysfunction (attention: β = –0.274, P &lt; 0.001; frontal/executive domain: β = -0.234, P = 0.002) and greater NPS burden (motivation: β = 0.496, P &lt; 0.001; affective dysregulation: β = 0.409, P &lt; 0.001). Path analyses confirmed that the FA-WMN integrity completely mediate the Aβ-cognition relationship and partially mediate the Aβ-NPS relationship. In subgroup analyses within Aβ+PD group, striatal Aβ burden was associated with memory impairment (β = -0.391, P = 0.009) and increased severity of apathetic symptoms (β = 0.418, P = 0.004), with both relationships mediated through the compromised MD-WMN integrity.

Our findings suggest that coexistent Aβ may elicit additive vulnerability in WM microstructures in patients with PD. Considering the mediating role of WM network
integrity in the effect of Aβ on clinical measures, WM network degeneration may serve as a potential intermediate pathway through which Aβ copathology contributes to cognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestation in PD.
