The primary underlying factor in Parkinson's disease (PD) is the buildup of ɑ-synuclein, affecting dopaminergic pathways. Recent research has shifted toward understanding non-motor deficits in PD, given its shared cognitive and neuropsychiatric characteristics with Alzheimer's disease. However, the relationship between alpha-synuclein and non-motor symptoms has shown inconsistent results, prompting a focus on a mixed-pathology perspective, particularly amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. Previous studies suggest associations between alpha-synuclein and Aβ, with over 30% of late-stage PD cases exhibiting Aβ prevalence.

Traditionally, motor symptoms like resting tremors and bradykinesia are primary indicators of PD, but non-motor symptoms, especially neuropsychiatric ones, often precede classic motor symptoms, common in early stages, and significantly impact the quality of life. However, an association between white matter (WM) abnormalities in PD and Aβ deposition has not been established. This study aims to identify where Aβ accumulates and investigate WM as an additional target influenced by Aβ. The role of white matter in signal relay suggests that the neocortical burden emerges as a potential stressor in PD due to retrograde nigrostriatal degeneration. The observed heterogeneity in PD indicates widespread microstructural changes across the brain, extending beyond the nigrostriatal pathway5, even in the absence of obvious brain atrophy

Despite the growing recognition of concurrent Alzheimer pathology as one of the major factors that aggravates cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in
Parkinson’s disease (PD), the mechanistic link between these symptoms and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated whether Aβ elicit white matter (WM) network disruption and further explored the potential clinical consequences.

This retrospective study included patients with PD who underwent 18 F-florbetaben positron emission tomography, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), and neuropsychological
assessments. After extracting Aβ-susceptible structural WM networks by comparing DTI-metrics (Fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) according to Aβ status, multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to explore the potential associations between Aβ burden, integrity of identified WM networks, and clinical measures (cognitive performance and NPS). We then performed mediation analyses to determine whether the network integrity mediated the effect of Aβ on clinical measures.

Among 165 patients enrolled, 48 showed amyloid-positive (Aβ+) scan (29.1%). Based on FA-weighted (FA-WMN) and MD-weighted WM networks (MD-WMN) derived from the difference in regional Aβ burden, Aβ+PD patients revealed more severe and widespread WM microstructural alterations particularly involving cortico-cortical and
cortico-striatal-limbic WM networks. Global Aβ burden was associated with cognitive dysfunction (attention: β = –0.274, P &lt; 0.001; frontal/executive domain: β = -0.234, P = 0.002) and greater NPS burden (motivation: β = 0.496, P &lt; 0.001; affective dysregulation: β = 0.409, P &lt; 0.001). Path analyses confirmed that the FA-WMN integrity completely mediate the Aβ-cognition relationship and partially mediate the Aβ-NPS relationship. In subgroup analyses within Aβ+PD group, striatal Aβ burden was associated with memory impairment (β = -0.391, P = 0.009) and increased severity of apathetic symptoms (β = 0.418, P = 0.004), with both relationships mediated through the compromised MD-WMN integrity.

Our findings suggest that coexistent Aβ may elicit additive vulnerability in WM microstructures in patients with PD. Considering the mediating role of WM network
integrity in the effect of Aβ on clinical measures, WM network degeneration may serve as a potential intermediate pathway through which Aβ copathology contributes to cognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestation in PD.


Parkinson’s disease (PD) is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disorder extending beyond its classical motor symptoms. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations, often preceding motor onset, are thought to arise from mixed pathological processes involving both α-synuclein and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation.

This study investigated whether Aβ copathology contributes to white matter (WM) network disruption in PD and how such alterations relate to cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Using diffusion tensor imaging and amyloid PET data, we identified Aβ-susceptible WM networks and assessed their mediating role between Aβ burden and clinical symptoms.

Results revealed that Aβ-positive PD patients exhibited widespread microstructural degeneration within cortico-striatal-limbic and cortico-cortical pathways. Moreover, the integrity of these WM networks mediated the effects of Aβ on cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions.

Together, these findings suggest that Aβ-related WM network vulnerability represents a key intermediate mechanism linking molecular pathology to behavioral phenotypes, offering a network-based perspective on PD heterogeneity.
